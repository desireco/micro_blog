So for the record, I tried to go shampoo free, for like 4-5 days and it didn't work out for me. I heard from few people that it really works well, but I really didn't like it.

To be honest, it seems that you need to endure it for like a month, which is too much for me, I really didn't like how my hear felt like it.

My thing is to wash my hair 3-5 times. Most people in my household don't like my method and think it is crazy. My youngest has beautiful blonde hair and she does wash it 2-3 times, because I told her so :).
