I just want to point out, that while this chill deep house theme was playing, I was able to setup a new blog, configure everything, explore different kind of posts, shortcodes, tie it to be published on Netlify, connect it to Micro.blog, tie crossposting to Twitter and while it is still playing, waiting for posts to show up on Twitter. Cool.
