The other day, my son come home from school and asked me: "Dad, do you know what NoRedInk is?". He totally didn't expect me to jump and ask him excitedly "YOU ARE USING NOREDINK AT SCHOOL" (It is fancy Montessori school, what can I say). Then I sat him by me, explained how NoRedInk uses most advanced language on the planet called Elm, which makes it ultimate tool to help kids correct their writing. Next step, learning Elm :).
