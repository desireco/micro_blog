I want to explain few random posts on Twitter and LinkedIn, I created new blog, publishing workflow 
and my "microblog" posts get automagically posted to Twitter and LinkedIn. Homepage is at https://softwaredevelopmentinchicago.com/
and so far I am happy that I can write and post about things I care about and it will be shared everywhere that is relevant.
