I was planning to post really cool Craftwerk album that I use for working, but in the meantime, thanks to Youtube amazing recommendation engine, I ended up enjoying Italo Disco quite a bit and it puts me in groove for work. It does look weird how much I move while I work, but I am having fun.

Both are solid for working.
