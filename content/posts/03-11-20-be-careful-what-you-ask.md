## Or, be careful what you are asking for

Funny thing is, that you will get what you ask for. 

At the place where I work, we have a really big project. And one of the issues we faced most of the past year was, that we were not even close to the state to release it. And you can’t learn anything about the product if you don’t let customers use it. 

So that was a problem. 

I complained often about that. 

My boss decided that it makes sense what I am saying and asked managers in charge to make things happen... well... the thing is... he asked them to deliver version 1.0 of the product. Probably hinted or promised some kind of reward.

Here is a funny thing. We are still where we are, in the state of incompleteness and chaos. But did a version 1.0 got delivered? Oh yeah, and with fanfare.

Now emboldened with their success, they are already working on version 1.2, after delivering 1.1 in the meantime. 

Are those complete? Not really, we are still putting foundational things that would be there in place for some kind of MVP.

So, be careful what you are asking for.
