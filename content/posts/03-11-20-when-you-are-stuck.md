I talked to a friend today about how he got stuck with a coding problem that in the end turned out to be very simple. It took him several days and a lot of frustration before he discovered solution. 

It wasn’t pleasant experience. While he was struggling, he questioned his skills and abilities, wondered if he is still as good as he was in the past.

It happened to everyone. Usually when it happens to me, it is past 3:30pm. I noticed that what seemed simple problem in the morning, would be something I can get stuck on after 4pm. Same thing would look super easy in the evening, if I look at it again.

So what to do when you are stuck. I have small 3x5 on which I wrote some of the things I can try if I feel frustrated with a problem. I have few of those with different options for different situations.

Here are some of the highlights:

- go to washroom and splash water on your face (it helps me refresh)
- stand up and go for a walk
	change your environment or just a mode of being (standing up) is very helpful
- explain that problem to someone, maybe even write it down if you don’t have anyone to explain
- Explain that problem to someone famous, explain Ruby problem to Matz or DHH for example.
- What would XX do? (XX - someone you admire and is known to be good at this skill) 
	This last one helped me more time then I want to admit. If you watched youtube videos of another developer you admire, just imagining this person talking to you and repeating a problem and then offering suggestions is very powerful.
- what would be smallest next step I could do

- what would be the smallest next step I could do
    this one is inspired by GTD and it can be very powerful when we are overwhelmed with the task and don’t feel like starting
- what could I try to, list all the things you can try to resolve the issue you are stuck with
- what is this problem in essence, what is the kind of problem? Once you identify what kind of problem is, what is category, you have the usual steps people use to resolve it.

There is many more. I would often check what time of day is and schedule work during the time when I feel like I have more chance.

Rescheduling work is really effective, especially if you are not making any progress currently, so spending more time on it doesn’t bring any benefit anyway.
