I had previous blog linger without any real posts. I thought about shutting thing down and releasing domain name. But I do have desire to write. It just takes too much time and planning to express what new and notable is in a form of coherent post.

Recently I discovered https://micro.blog/ network. It make total sense. Often I find really cool video, or link to article. Or I just have short insight. I could use Twitter, which is original micro post network. But this is like yelling at the stadium.

I want to preserve my learning and growing, for others, who follow me and are interested, but mostly for myself, so I can see what I was reading, learning in the past and to be able to look at that from distance.

For those reasons, I want to try again.
