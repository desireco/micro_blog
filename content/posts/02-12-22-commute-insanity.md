Current state of corporations is such that time is wasted everywhere and in huge amounts. One great way to waste time and pollute environment is to commute to work every day.

It really make sense when you are working in factory. Or as modern office environment is factory of paperwork, it made sense to ask people to be present there at same time.

I don't think for majority of organization that it makes sense to ask people to be present in single place every day for 8 hours. There is just no need and by asking everyone to travel at the same time, it is just logistical nightmare.

There should definitely be place like office and people present there at some point during the day if they need to be there.

Same like businesses saw open floor plan as competitive advantage as it reduced highly costs for office space, this can also lead to more sane workplace and also huge reduction in office space needed.

If you create organization where people are present in office during times when they are needed to collaborate, plan and organize work. You simple need different space. Space with creative floor plan. You might not even need personal space for everyone working, if they are not in the office all the time.
