I am complelled to write this as a reaction to how people implement agile mostly, but also to so many terrible office trends.

Current state of corporations is such that time is wasted everywhere and in huge amounts.

It is wasted for example during commute to work that everyone is doing at the same time. I can write about that some other time. What I want to focus now is 3 core issues that prevent people from being productive:

- excessive agile ceremonies
- open space
- 8h continuous work day

Well meaning corporation A decides that it wants to be modern and fancy and adopts Scrum of all the ways how you can be unproductive. Now, Scrum in itself is actually really cool way to be productive and kick ass, except, you know, reasons, usually related to corporate power dynamics.

OK, so when smart people were thinking of agile methods and how to make people work better, they were responding to what they saw, which was in 1990 or so (Agile Manifesto was written Feb 2001). We simply don't have same problems people at the time had. Not at all.

One of the problem people felt is lack of communication and feedback loop with customer.

It is wasted on commute to work that everyone is doing at roughly the same time, it is waste
I would say, it starts with your commute to work, you are essentially commuting somewhere at specifici time with thousands of others at the same time every day. Need for people to be present wwhole day in the office, unless you are working as a cashier at the supermarket is not as essential. Actually it is quite the opposite. DHH and Jason Friend write about that in Rework.

That doesn't mean to say that you don't need plenty of face time with your coworkers, this is not what I am saying. You do need to collaborate and work together, especially when you are plannig and trying to solve problems.

So
