ðŸŒ¿ Seeking Non-Technical Cofounder â€“ Wellness Meets Tech ðŸ”¬

Iâ€™m building a technological platform that blends medical testing with deep data analysis to deliver clear, actionable insights into personal wellness.

Our goal: simplify complex health data and help people take meaningful control of their well-being.

Iâ€™m looking for a non-technical cofounder with a background in health, fitness, or wellness who can bring more than expertise â€” someone who contributes leadership, strategic vision, market insight, and fundraising acumen to help shape and scale a product that truly matters.

ðŸ’¡ You might be:

A wellness or healthcare professional with business instincts

A former founder or advisor ready for a new mission

Deeply tuned into health trends, consumer behavior, and whatâ€™s next

Excited about turning vision into traction, and data into real-world impact

This is a cofounder-level opportunity â€” with equity, deep ownership, and creative freedom.

If this resonates with you â€” or you know someone who fits this energy â€” letâ€™s connect. DMs are open.
