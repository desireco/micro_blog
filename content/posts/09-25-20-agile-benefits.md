Companies that practice Agile methodologies or want to jump on board with this “modern” methodologies, they want flexibility and gain customer focus. These are often benefits of going agile. 

There is one benefit that makes a huge difference and for most part people don’t understand it and don’t know to utilize it properly. It is a principle of starting fresh.

In Agile, every sprint, every week, even every day is a new start. Whatever was before is put behind and you are starting anew. This let’s you put behind and overcome any issues from before and focus on what you want to accomplish with least amount of burden on your team.

For personal agile, when you plan your life every week and realign yourself to your goals and projects, this is especially beneficial. Whatever issues you had before, you can still start fresh and focus on what you want to accomplish in next week, usually for personal agile, week equates as sprint.

So every week, start fresh. Go to catalog/backlog of goals and actions which ones you want to pursue. There will be themes that will play along longer for sure, but each week you are free to start fresh.

I don't think this is emphasised nearly enough and it makes a huge difference.
