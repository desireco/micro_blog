        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I am interested in developing my &lt;strong&gt;TypeScript&lt;/strong&gt; skills for current work, restarting using &lt;strong&gt;Elm and Phoenix&lt;/strong&gt; for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Creating A New Blog</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had previous blog linger without any real posts. I thought about shutting thing down and releasing domain name. But I do have desire to write. It just takes too much time and planning to express what new and notable is in a form of coherent post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://micro.blog/&#34;&gt;https://micro.blog/&lt;/a&gt; network. It make total sense. Often I find really cool video, or link to article. Or I just have short insight. I could use Twitter, which is original micro post network. But this is like yelling at the stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to preserve my learning and growing, for others, who follow me and are interested, but mostly for myself, so I can see what I was reading, learning in the past and to be able to look at that from distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those reasons, I want to try again.&lt;/p&gt;
