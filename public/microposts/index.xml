      <description>I feel like Facebook is doing absolutely right thing for completely wrong reasons. It will be open-sourced in the end anyway, so I think this is fantastic news.

      <description>This is really good article about how futile is to commute today, especially for places that make all collaboration tools. Anyhow, I plan to expand on it in future, but for now, here it is.

      <description>So, there was some issue with titles being messed up for microposts, and @help was suggesting that killing titles for microposts is best strategy. So hopefully this will work.</description>

      <description>I just want to point out, that while this chill deep house theme was playing, I was able to setup a new blog, configure everything, explore different kind of posts, shortcodes, tie it to be published on Netlify, connect it to Micro.blog, tie crossposting to Twitter and while it is still playing, waiting for posts to show up on Twitter. Cool.</description>

      <description>Just started a new microblog (look it up) on https://micro.blog and https://softwaredevelopmentinchicago.com/ and things look good. Now let&amp;rsquo;s see if this will cross post to Twitter and LinkedIn. So far, things are super cool.</description>
