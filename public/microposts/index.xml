      <description>I found this video of physicist explaining new approach to defining the universe and liked it. It is short and she explains her ideas quite well.

      <description>I was planning to post really cool Craftwerk album that I use for working, but in the meantime, thanks to Youtube amazing recommendation engine, I ended up enjoying Italo Disco quite a bit and it puts me in groove for work. It does look weird how much I move while I work, but I am having fun.
  OK, here is Craftwerk as well.
  Both are solid for working.</description>

      <description>The other day, my son come home from school and asked me: &amp;ldquo;Dad, do you know what NoRedInk is?&amp;rdquo;. He totally didn&amp;rsquo;t expect me to jump and ask him excitedly &amp;ldquo;YOU ARE USING NOREDINK AT SCHOOL&amp;rdquo; (It is fancy Montessori school, what can I say). Then I sat him by me, explained how NoRedInk uses most advanced language on the planet called Elm, which makes it ultimate tool to help kids correct their writing.</description>

      <description>I was brewing myself some loose leaf green tea and thinking about how green tea is the most misunderstood tea ever. Unless you are asian, most people completely miss how to brew this tea properly, kill the taste and genuinely can&amp;rsquo;t enjoy this wonderful tea.</description>

      <description>My son came to me this afternoon, &amp;ldquo;Hey Dad, did you hear about Picard&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, I stopped him before he finished his sentence&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Son, we are StarWars family.&amp;rdquo;.
He looked at me&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Sooo, no?&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Exactly.&amp;rdquo;
I do hear it is a good movie though and have huge respect for actors&amp;hellip; Apparently it is a series. We are after all StarWars family.</description>

      <description>Eevee has a long and exhaustive post about history of html and css. I forgot a lot of these things, how we had to put FONT (in caps) for every tag. Anyhow, it is fantastic read and spend time remembering or learning about it, if you are younger, it is well worth it to remember where we all came from.

      <description>This is perfectly amusing story about someone elses crash and burn in startupville. This guy is honest, he is smart, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent him from making dumb mistakes. Excellent read.

      <description>This is post from 2015 but titles are really fantastic for any developer to experience especially if they didn&amp;rsquo;t read those before.
And I apparently forgot to include link :). Have no idea what was so fantastic.</description>

      <description>Adam Watham creator of TailWind CSS, a library/framework that features utility classes explains here his reasoning and why it makes sense to use TailWind. I find his reasoning compelling.

      <description>I found this grid while I was researching CSS frameworks. It is really beautiful and elegant and just right for many projects. Check it out, it is less then 20 lines of code.

      <description>So a funny thing happened. I am starting a new project and wanted to use (Tachyons)[https://tachyons.io/]. So I did training on one website, really fantastic, totally sold me on idea of using it.
So I add it to a project and nothing works, and classes I am writing are like sh*t and completely not working. I was completely confused. And I kept googling for Tachyons and the closest thing I found was some articles on PostCSS and more verbose classes for Tachyons.</description>

      <description>This is really good article about how futile is to commute today, especially for places that make all collaboration tools. Anyhow, I plan to expand on it in future, but for now, here it is.

      <description>So, there was some issue with titles being messed up for microposts, and @help was suggesting that killing titles for microposts is best strategy. So hopefully this will work.</description>

      <description>I just want to point out, that while this chill deep house theme was playing, I was able to setup a new blog, configure everything, explore different kind of posts, shortcodes, tie it to be published on Netlify, connect it to Micro.blog, tie crossposting to Twitter and while it is still playing, waiting for posts to show up on Twitter. Cool.</description>
