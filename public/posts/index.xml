<p>When Yukihiro Matsumoto, affectionately known as Matz, introduced the concept that a developer&rsquo;s happiness is a pivotal aspect of development, it was a revelation. It emphasized that producing quality work isn&rsquo;t just about the end product, but also about the journey and the well-being of those involved. This philosophy resonated deeply with me, reminding me of the Agile Manifesto&rsquo;s pioneers who championed innovative ways to enhance work quality. Inspired by these trailblazers, I present &ldquo;Augmented Developers&rdquo; – my vision to elevate the quality of our work while ensuring the utmost satisfaction for everyone involved.</p>
<h2 id="current-landscape-of-software-development">Current landscape of software development</h2>
<p>Today&rsquo;s software development landscape is a maze of challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>We navigate an increasingly intricate work environment.</li>
<li>Technologies evolve and complicate at a breakneck pace.</li>
<li>The platforms for delivery have diversified like never before.</li>
<li>While we have access to phenomenal tools, their sheer number can be overwhelming.</li>
<li>The demand for versatility in skills and expertise has skyrocketed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amidst these challenges, we also grapple with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients whose expectations shift and sometimes remain ambiguous.</li>
<li>The daunting task of managing and updating legacy codebases.</li>
<li>Keeping up with the relentless speed of technological advancements.</li>
<li>Overcoming process inefficiencies and systemic breakdowns.</li>
<li>In this complex scenario, &ldquo;Augmented Developers&rdquo; aims to be the beacon, guiding us towards excellence and satisfaction in our craft.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-augmented-developer-a-new-breed-of-problem-solver">The Augmented Developer: A New Breed of Problem Solver</h2>
<p>In the ever-evolving realm of software development, a new archetype emerges: the &ldquo;Augmented Developer.&rdquo; Defined not just by their skills but by a unique blend of tools and a forward-thinking mindset, these developers stand a class apart. While traditional developers have laid the foundation, Augmented Developers build upon it, bringing innovation and adaptability to the forefront.</p>
<h2 id="strategies-for-navigating-client-expectations">Strategies for Navigating Client Expectations</h2>
<p>The Augmented Developer understands that at the heart of every project lies effective communication. By setting clear boundaries and expectations, they ensure a harmonious collaboration. They harness the power of prototyping, wireframing, and visualization tools, creating a shared vision with clients. Moreover, they play the role of educators, guiding clients through the maze of technology choices to arrive at solutions that are both optimal and future-proof.</p>
<h2 id="tackling-the-legacy-codebase-challenge">Tackling the Legacy Codebase Challenge</h2>
<p>We will just not do it&hellip; only greenfield projects to start as legacy is adding complexity for which we don&rsquo;t have good enough processes at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="simplifying-and-refactoring-ceremonies">Simplifying and refactoring ceremonies</h2>
<p>In the intricate ballet of software development, ceremonies play a pivotal role. However, not all ceremonies add value. As Augmented Developers, our primary objective is to foster meaningful communication with our clients. We strive to deeply understand their needs, aspirations, and challenges. This understanding is the bedrock upon which we build solutions.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the catch: time is a finite resource. Every minute spent in redundant ceremonies is a minute taken away from crafting the right solutions. Moreover, unnecessary ceremonies don&rsquo;t just consume time; they also drain financial resources. In an industry where both time and budget are often tight, this is a luxury we cannot afford.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are on a mission to simplify and refactor our ceremonies. We are trimming the fat, eliminating processes that don&rsquo;t directly contribute to understanding our client&rsquo;s needs or delivering apt solutions. This streamlined approach ensures that every meeting, every discussion, and every collaboration is purpose-driven. It&rsquo;s not about doing more; it&rsquo;s about doing what&rsquo;s right. By focusing our energies on what truly matters, we are better positioned to deliver solutions that resonate, solutions that make a difference.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-end-it-is-a-ever-evolving-process">In the end, it is a ever evolving process</h2>
<p>Our journey in software development is akin to navigating the vast expanse of an ever-changing landscape. The processes we adhere to today are the culmination of our collective experiences, learnings, and reflections up to this point. They represent our best understanding of how to deliver exceptional value to our clients efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>However, we recognize that the world of technology and client needs are in a state of constant flux. As we continue to undertake more projects and face new challenges, our perspectives will shift, and our strategies will adapt. This evolution is not just inevitable; it&rsquo;s embraced. We see it as an opportunity to refine our approach, to sharpen our methodologies, and to discover even better ways of working.</p>
<p>Our commitment is unwavering: to relentlessly pursue improvement. We are dedicated to enhancing our processes, not for the sake of change, but to find the optimal balance that serves both our team and our esteemed clients. We believe that by staying agile, receptive, and proactive, we can ensure that our processes remain as dynamic and innovative as the solutions we provide.</p>
<p>Having written all this, I have to add&hellip;</p>
<p>With joy,</p>

            <title>Groundhog Day</title>
            <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/04-03-23-groundhog-day/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 14:25:55 -0500</pubDate>
            
            <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/04-03-23-groundhog-day/</guid>
            <description>Imagine being trapped in a never-ending cycle where each day is a repetition of the previous one, with little to no change. This is the premise of the classic comedy-drama film &amp;ldquo;Groundhog Day,&amp;rdquo; in which the protagonist, Phil Connors, finds himself living the same day over and over again. While the movie is a work of fiction, it serves as a compelling metaphor for the experiences of individuals with ADHD, particularly those who work as programmers.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Imagine being trapped in a never-ending cycle where each day is a repetition of the previous one, with little to no change. This is the premise of the classic comedy-drama film &ldquo;Groundhog Day,&rdquo; in which the protagonist, Phil Connors, finds himself living the same day over and over again. While the movie is a work of fiction, it serves as a compelling metaphor for the experiences of individuals with ADHD, particularly those who work as programmers.</p>
<p>For me as a programmer, daily life can feel like a perpetual Groundhog Day. There are things and projects I would like to accomplish, which I am trying really hard to work on and focus. Then weeks, months and sometimes year later, I would find notes on the projects I wanted to do then&hellip; and it is the same projects and things I am trying to do now. And when this happens this is just soul-crushing.</p>
<p>ADHD is characterized by difficulty in sustaining attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. These symptoms can manifest in various ways, but for programmers, they may lead to struggles with time management, task completion, and organization.</p>
<p>Just as Phil Connors is unable to escape the cycle of February 2nd, programmers with ADHD may find themselves stuck in a loop of unfinished projects and missed deadlines. The fast-paced, detail-oriented nature of coding can be overwhelming for those who struggle to maintain focus. Additionally, the constant demand for multitasking and the need to switch between different tasks can exacerbate the symptoms of ADHD.</p>
<p>Scrum methodology with endless meetings definitely doesn&rsquo;t help and is especially difficult for people like me. And people like me&hellip; there is a lot of my colleagues who are like me, it seems that programming attracts people like me and our messed up brains are especially good at programming.</p>
<p>I am in constant search of new organizational methods and ways how I can sustain my focus so I can make what I always wanted to make.</p>
<p>Other people say there are advantages to have a mind like I do (definitely agree) in terms of creativity, ideas, enthysiasm that you can produce. I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t want to lose any of that, but it is really hard when you realize you were &ldquo;looping&rdquo; for months and years over something really simple.</p>
<p>Breaking the loop of Groundhog Day requires a combination of self-awareness, support, and strategies. Here is what I found elsewhere suggested and I am trying to apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Structure Your Day: Create a daily routine with clear priorities and set achievable goals. Utilize time management tools, such as timers or scheduling apps, to stay on track.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimize Distractions: Designate a workspace free of distractions, and use noise-cancelling headphones or white noise machines to block out external sounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take Regular Breaks: Allow yourself regular breaks to recharge and regain focus. Practice mindfulness techniques or engage in physical activity to reduce stress. Walks outside help a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leverage Your Strengths: Embrace your creativity and problem-solving skills. Identify tasks that align with your strengths and interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek Support: Connect with others who have similar experiences, talk to your colleagues who struggle like you, it will help immensely knowing others have similar problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listening to ambient music really helps a lot.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Like in the movie, you have to break the loop, do the work, make the Win. It happens, but it requires a lot of energy and often people don&rsquo;t understand how much emotional energy it takes to accomplish some simple things that they take for granted.</p>

<p>Remote work can result in significant cost savings for businesses. By reducing the need for office space, companies can lower their overhead expenses, such as rent, utilities, and office supplies. Additionally, remote work can lead to decreased employee absenteeism, as employees can continue working even when they are unwell or facing personal challenges.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-end">In the end</h3>
<p>My experience with remote work has been overwhelmingly positive, offering a multitude of benefits like time savings, increased productivity, enhanced flexibility, and environmental sustainability. As remote work continues to gain traction, it is crucial for organizations to adapt and embrace the new ways of managing remote teams to ensure success in this ever-evolving landscape. By leveraging these benefits, companies can foster a more engaged, productive, and satisfied workforce while contributing to a greener, more sustainable future.</p>

            <description>I am part of the NessLabs community and recently a member of NessLabs, a lovely women presented a topic of a whole year of creative experiments.
Idea is to always have some small projects to work on, that will be limited in scope and will bring you joy and happiness of exploring new areas in your life or expanding existing ones.
It works like this:
Make a list of experiments you would like to do You would pick a single experiment every month.</description>

<p>Idea is to always have some small projects to work on, that will be limited in scope and will bring you joy and happiness of exploring new areas in your life or expanding existing ones.</p>
<p>It works like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a list of experiments you would like to do</li>
<li>You would pick a single experiment every month.</li>
<li>They also need to be small and easily achievable</li>
<li>Experiment has to be defined clearly with outcome and goal that you want to accomplish</li>
</ul>
<p>You create a list of 12 things you will do throughout the year. Assign every experiment to month and start. And if you change your mind along the way, it is fine, replace, remove, add. But once you start working on something, do it till completion. Or at least try to finish it.</p>
<p>And if you fail in some, so what. There is always next month and another experiment waiting for you.</p>
<p>They just have to be small enough to be done in a month.</p>
<h3 id="my-modifications">My modifications</h3>
<p>I wanted to tweak this a little bit.</p>
<p>First I created a list of experiments that I would like to do.
Not all are good to work in a month. So I decided to size them:
S - small - 2 weeks
M - medium - 4 weeks ie. a month
L - large - 6 weeks (more like Jason Friend sprint)</p>
<p>One of the first is to write to blog just 3 posts and 15 microposts.
This is for end of March goal.</p>
<p>Before that I re-created and re-thought image of Dakic OnLine. That turned out to be way more fun then I expected it to be. I thought I will just rethink who are customers are and how we want to serve them. In the end, I realized that what would make me happy is to be a force of good in this world and re-thought the whole mission.
There is a blog post about it.</p>
<p>I already wrote about Remote Work. I have 2 part article about AI almost done.
I would like to write about experience of having ADHD.
I have some thoughts about modern management and planning, I will start writing about it and we will see if this makes sense or not.</p>
<p>So, I am already half way through my second experiment and it is fun and I am enjoying.</p>
<p>People are wired to create and this lets you make more and easier.</p>
<p>So this is my experience, maybe I can inspire you to also do this?</p>

            <description>I asked ChatGPT-3.5 to make a song about our mission to make a world a better place, here is what it came up with:
Innovation and technology,
They make our lives so bright,
They bring us all together,
And help us see the light.
Dakic OnLine, the name we know,
The company with a vision,
To make our world a better place,
With endless innovation.
Through software, through devices,
Through all the things we see,</description>

            <description>This post is about my values that I defined long time ago and some tweaks I want to add as I think things through.
It is long and rambly post, you can find conclusion near the end.
In the past For a very long time mission of Dakic OnLine was to &amp;ldquo;create better business online using innovation&amp;rdquo; or specifically
&amp;ldquo;Creating Better Business in Economy of Ideas&amp;rdquo;
I tried my best to uphold those values, mostly by trying to offer innovative solutions and using latest technology to give our clients an edge.</description>

<h3 id="in-the-past">In the past</h3>
<p>For a very long time mission of Dakic OnLine was to &ldquo;create better business online using innovation&rdquo; or specifically</p>
<p>&ldquo;Creating Better Business in Economy of Ideas&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried my best to uphold those values, mostly by trying to offer innovative solutions and using latest technology to give our clients an edge.</p>
<p>In some other way, I failed to do some really more substantial impact on business climate and innovation.</p>
<p>Few times we were close, PersistentPenny and Zelio were really good ways to support smaller businesses but I didn&rsquo;t follow through to fully make them reality.</p>
<p>Yes I was on top of technology, businesses got to use Rails even before it was cool. Stakeholders were laughing at using methodology Extreme Programming and Agile. Along the way there were some interesting solutions that allowed people to break grounds that they would not otherwise.</p>
<p>We also spearheaded PWAs, a Progressive WebApps, an alternative to mobile app development. So instead of building web app, IOS and Android, huge hassle with appstores etc. you just build a single responsive app that has most of features as mobile apps, and if it gets traction, we can then develop native apps.</p>
<p>I think this last one saved one startup a ton of money. It still didn&rsquo;t help them in the end because their problem was never software.</p>
<p>I also made sure that people who work for us are treated nicely and paid well and on time, even if we were not.</p>
<p>So that is how I worked in the past.</p>
<h3 id="how-good-were-we">How good were we?</h3>
<p>There is nothing wrong with this approach.</p>
<p>One thing that was always bothering me, we didn&rsquo;t create any products that made small businesses and others genuinely work better and get some insane value from us. There were some products for marketing we did but kind of didn&rsquo;t really went all in with those, but that is as close to creating something that would genuinely improve business online, which was my goal.</p>
<p>My goal was to use innovation and technlogy to improve doing business online.</p>
<p>By my own measures, this failed, I just don&rsquo;t feel I accomplished what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Few times we were really close to do just that but somehow we didn&rsquo;t, things fizzled out.</p>
<h3 id="what-didnt-work">What didn&rsquo;t work</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think innovation how I imagined it worked or maybe it was just how implemented it.</p>
<p>I had methodology which would create wires, prototype, high figelity mvp, then mvp.</p>
<p>I had really hard time getting clients to finance this even though it was in their interest not to waste money on development they ultimately don&rsquo;t need. They were just wasting money and then scrambled when they are short on funds to cut features or future work.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-i-want-to-do-now">What do I want to do now</h3>
<p>I had recently talked with EvilInsuranceCorp (not their real name) to work for them. I saw this as opportunity to improve on experience patients have when are reviewing coverage and how their payments are going through. That didn&rsquo;t go through and  it was for the better.</p>
<p>I read article today that they have AI alghoritm to deny coverage to people based on some profit factors, not really if patient needs that coverage. There was sad story of elderly people being denied coverage and using all their hard earned savings to cover for life saving treatment.</p>
<p>Not really &lsquo;A Force For Good&rsquo; like I want to see myself.</p>
<p>This got me thinking. This &ldquo;Better Business OnLine&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t really work for a long time already, nor it made me happy.</p>
<p>What I really always wanted is to be &ldquo;A Force For Good&rdquo;, even if this drove some people crazy.</p>
<p>So I thought about what I really like and how I want to work. I came up with following mission and have some idea how to go about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making People Lives Better Through Innovation And Technology&rdquo;</p>
<p>From businesses, I would like to focus on individual people and work on what makes their lives better and how I can improve their experience of living.</p>
<p>This can be a startup founder, but it can be a consumer as well.</p>
<p>I thought about doing something for developers, but&hellip; that is tricky and I never wanted to be just focused on developers.</p>
<p>So I will be focused on individual happines and accomplishment first.</p>
<p>I think my focus on businesses was mostly influenced by people online who said it is hard to do consumer apps and there is way more value to be provided for small and medium business.</p>
<p>I want to work with people first. Maybe this is influence of me doing Design Systems and Design Thinking, to be so people focused, but I think I always was interested in how people are using software I was involved in making.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>From now on:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Making People Lives Better Through Innovation And Technology&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>it might sound mundane but it is what I genuinely want to do.</p>
